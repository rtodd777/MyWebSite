      Professional Profile

Currently, I am a Senior Technical Architect working for the AT&T
Corporation in Atlanta, GA. Over the years, I have served as the
technical architect for setting the corporate strategy and architecture
for the development and implementation of Enterprise Metadata
Repositories (knowledge stores), Online Ordering for internal
procurement, Collaboration tools, Web 2.0 and Wireless technologies.
Today, I spend most of my time performing the function of Desktop
Software Architect and Cloud Computing.

For the past 32 years, I have worked in the Information Technology field
including leadership positions at: AT&T, BellSouth, Cingular,
Georgia-Pacific, The Coca-Cola Company, Southern Linen, Fannie Mae
Software Systems, Lummus Industries, and The Georgia Company.

While I am an Architect by day, I love web design and the fundamentals
of information architecture. I use this web site to learn new
technologies and how design can enable trust. Between 2003 through 2007,
I wrote a monthly column in DMReview and delivered keynotes, tutorials
and educational sessions for a wide variety of technology conferences
around the world. I am a student of organizations trying to get a handle
on their internal knowledge management- how they acquire, how they
broker it, and how they disseminate it through out the corporation.
Understanding information has replaced physical assets as the driver of
value leads me to believe that the management of those information-based
assets is critical to the future growth of business. On this, I have
been awarded Fifteen U.S. patents in the field of technology.

I hold degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science from Columbus State
University, an MBA degree from Georgia State University, and a Ph.D. in
Information Systems from Nova Southeastern University. The majority of
my research is focused on Metadata Reuse, Cloud Computing, Repository
Design, Enabling Trust within the Internet, Usability and Repository
Frameworks. In addition, I have co-authored various books on Service
Oriented Architectures, Open Source, Enterprise 2.0, Virtual
Environments, and Integrating Web 2.0 technologies.

    Trademark 2.0

Defining Your Value in a Web 2.0 World.

My Book

Globalization has taken on a whole new definition and meaning since 1999
when only a few organizations sent work overseas during the Y2k crises.
Today, just about every organization is trying to stay competitive by
sending operations, development, and design to countries such as India,
China, or Russia. For the information worker the facts can be unnerving
to say the least. While the percent of jobs lost due to outsourcing
remains in the single digits, no one can deny the trend of exponential
growth will continue. With research firms continuously publishing
reports on how organizations can leverage technology from these
countries, there will be no shortage of fear in the coming years.

Hardly an information technology book or magazine can be picked up that
does not mention the focus to achieve enterprise effectiveness or share
information in a manner that allows the organization to react in an
effective manner across the entire supply chain. The result of these
efforts to lower the costs and gain a competitive advantage within the
supply chain has lead to a much more diverse community of individual
suppliers. This transformation from hierarchal controlling structures to
distributed flat organizations has created what Dan Pink calls the Free
Agent Nation. The reality is that free agents may not come from next
door but rather the next country. Employees need to adapt by creating
unique value propositions that are captured with their Trademark. This
book will discuss several dimensions of building a personal Trademark.
Unlike other books on this subject, this book will focus on the "How" an
individual can move from local labor to global talent in the new world
defined as Enterprise 2.0. Enterprise 2.0 commonly refers to
organizations that operate under an open communication model where
interaction and communication is encouraged from the top down.
Enterprises are accomplishing this feat by not only addressing the
technology requirements of Web 2.0 but the social and organizational
changes required to sustain a competitive advantage.

    Evolution of Design

Design is important and a huge interest for me personally. I started my
Personal Brand site development back in 1999 and as you can see from the
designs there has been some level of progress over the years. More than
anything, it's interesting to see the design differences. I love making
things better and more useful, design allows me to do just that.

    "Some of the author's points challenge conventional thinking and
    really made me re-evaluate some of my career and personal marketing
    plans. I really enjoyed some of the marketing ideas and intend to
    pursue several of them. I highly recommend this book to anyone in
    the IT or high tech world." - Unknown.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    "Those who have already read books from Eddie Obeng, Thomas
    Friedman, and James Martin will be familiar with the concepts and
    possibilities of the NewWorld and will recognize many of it's
    rapidly growing realities. With their `NewWorld of 2.0' `light
    switched on', they will be hungry to learn, and receptive to the
    `what' and `how' ideas that Trademark 2.0 has to offer. They will
    just get the `why', and get on with the process of learning. Please
    don't be misled by the title. The `2.0' is not something that only
    applies to techies. Whilst anyone who works in technology should
    have heard of '2.0' and will be more familiar with the subjects and
    capabilities talked about, such as blogs and wiki's, collaboration
    and knowledge management, it would be wrong, very wrong, to see this
    book as a book solely for techies. It's highly relevant to everyone.
    This book should trigger deep and profound thought. If it doesn't,
    there is probably a book called `In blissful ignorance' or perhaps
    `doomed' that needs to be written for you. For everyone else,
    Trademark 2.0 will have been time and money well spent." - A. Brooks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    "I really enjoyed reading Trademark 2.0. The author used examples
    throughout the book that perfectly illustrated his points. Some of
    the author's points challenge conventional thinking and really made
    me re-evaluate some of my career and personal marketing plans. I
    really enjoyed some of the marketing ideas and intend to pursue

    high tech world" - Unknown

    "R. Todd Stephens is a very interesting man. I've met him and have
    sat through an incredibly interesting tutorial he gave back in 2006
    in London on Enterprise Metadata. What interested me most about his
    presentation was how he was referring to tools and technologies that
    I was tinkering with to try and improve communication of key
    concepts and improve efficiencies in information management in my
    day job. Indeed, some of the tools were things I was playing with
    outside of work as a hobbyist blogger. It's a pity I haven't had a
    chance to implement too much of the vision that he triggered in my
    mind at that time for improvements in the day job, but who knows
    what might happen by the end of the year.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    He has recently published a book that sets out a recipe for
    establishing your personal brand (he uses the term trademark for a
    variety of reasons). Part of his thesis is that the collaborative
    tools of Web2.0 (the Read/Write Web as it is often called) have
    altered the rules for creating your personal brand and provide you
    with opportunities to raise your profile and, importantly, to
    measure how your profile is doing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    What sets this book apart in my eyes is that Todd adds value in
    interesting ways. Apart from just presenting bland statements about
    how "blogs are good" and conferences are great ways to see new
    places and meet new people, he presents a set of tools to measure
    and score how well your "trademark" is doing. He also sets out a
    reasoned argument as to why establishing a personal trademark for
    yourself may well be the career survival tool for the Read/Write
    Information Age.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    He brings together a variety of references and marries them together
    in support of his argument - and above all he provides examples of
    how you can 'speak with data' to track how well you are meeting or
    exceeding your own expectations of what your "brand" might be. From
    checking the site stats for your blog to your technorati rankings to
    having a 'scorecard' of the things you've done to promote your
    brand, Todd give some keen insights.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The fact that he is a world-class recognized authority on the
    management of meta-data is evidence of the success of his formula.
    The book at times reads somewhat autobiographically and it is clear
    that this is not a book based on a theoretical view of things or an
    attempt to leap on the airport business bookshelf bandwagon but
    rather an attempt to share a recipe that has worked.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I'll certainly be taking stock of how I'm doing. This blog is a key
    part of my personal trademark but after reading Todd's book I think
    that I might need to balance the scorecard a little bit more. The
    framework he presents gives me a road map to do this." - D. O'Brien.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    "I think trademark 2.0 is an excellent guide book for this race of
    NewWorld'ers who have the expertise but lack the ability to channel
    that knowledge and experience using new media and all the toys that
    web2.0 can provide" - D. Jones.
